* Systems Modeling - what is this?
  - what is a system
  - what is a model :-)
  - system boundary
  - system vs. context/env/plant
* The structure 
  - usually the hierarchical component/connector stuff
  - interfaces & ports
  - what goes over ports
  - instantiation
* Discrete vs. Continuous systems
  - what is dense time
* Modeling Discrete Systems
  - State Machines
  - Events
* Modeling Continuous Systems
  - Differential Equations
* Modeling both together: hybrid systems
* Dealing with Time
  - Time triggered systems
  - deadlines
* Tools
  - SysML (esp. State Machines)
