Introduction
-------------------------------

* Introduction of Guest

* What is CRISPR
  - Abbreviation?
  - What is it?
    "CRISPR, is a family of DNA sequences in bacteria that contains
     snippets of DNA from viruses that have attacked the bacterium"
  

Definitions of some terms
------------------------------------------

Even if this might make it a somewhat boring start of the 
episode, I think
we have to introduce a few concepts to our listeners for the rest of the
discussion to work. I think the following should suffice:

* DNA
* Gene

* RNA
* Enzymes
* Nuclease


From natural CRISPR to CRISPR/Cas9
------------------------------------------

* CRISPR is actually a naturally-occurring, ancient defense 
  mechanism found in a wide range of bacteria
  -> explain

* CRISPR: One DNA sequence would be repeated over and over again, 
  with unique sequences in between the repeats
  -> why?

* Cas9
  - CRISPR-associated proteins
  - which can precisely snip DNA and slice invading viruses. 

human defense



  - What was the breakthrough?
  - Why is it important?
  - Why do some people talk about CRISPR/CAS-9 and others CRISPR? 
    Is there a difference?


What is Genome Editing
--------------------------------------------  

* Genome Editing is not new, right?
  - How was it done before?
  - How is CRISPR/Cas better? (More precise, 
    targets more genes (up to 20))

* Replace a part of the genome with other genes
  - in order to repair destroyed ones
  - or to plug in different ones

* Targeted Genomic Cleavage, double stranded break
  - Homing Device
  - Endonuclease

* Gene Editing on Living cells seems to be new? 
  Practical, because no breeding of generations and 
  generations necessary in order to change genome.


How to do Genome Editing with CRISPR/Cas
-------------------------------------------


* Guide RNA 

* The prob that many genes are involved in 
  many things is still there, right?

* Cutting DNA alone is not enough, 
  because the cell might repair it randomly. 
  So we have to supply the spare.

* Different usage scenarios: 
  - homologous repair
    . gene knockout
    
    . gene tagging
    . site-specific mutogenesis
  - non-homologous end-joining repair
    . mutations
    . deletions insertions
    . knockouts

how do you do this in the lab?


* Simple: a transfection
  - what is this?
  - compared to what earlier?
  
* How does it work, specifically



* Promotor study, reporter gene  

* How does the actual technical lab process work?
  "All biologists have to do is feed Cas9 the right sequence, called a guide RNA, 
   and boom, you can cut and paste bits of DNA sequence into the genome wherever 
   you want. All you have to do is design a target sequence using an online tool 
   and order the guide RNA to match."


* Accuracy

  - how reliable are the editing processes?
  - how many percent do we need?
  
  
  
  - Occasionally the enzyme still cuts in the wrong place
    - Problem in practice?
    - reports on multiple non-targeted changes? 
      Up to thousands? 
      Was that completely rebutted?
  - How do you quality control that the editing went well?
  - is this a "on average" thing?

* Target many genes at once. 

* Compare to other approaches
  - zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) 
  - transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs)


Specific CRISPR applications
---------------------------------------

* It is currently a research tool or "industry ready?
  - how would it be used in research?

"embryo"

* Research tool "mouse editing"?
  - What is a knock-out mouse, how did 
  - How did you create them before,
  - how do you do it with CRISPR?

* Applications
  - from creating monkeys with targeted mutations 
  - to preventing HIV infection in human cells. 
  - potential to cure any genetic disease. 
  - And yes, it might even lead to designer babies.



Wrap Up
-------------------------------------
* Does (irrational) fear of GMOs carry over to CRISPR/Cas9 editing? 

 
* Why is it that CRISPR can be applied to all organisms, 
  not just the typical model ones?

* Also works in Stem Cells, so ...

* juman
  Ethical issues?

* Do legal restrictions on GMOs apply to CRISPR edited organisms?

* CRISPR could become a major force in ecology and conservation, 

* Which patent battles are being fought over medically relevant
  CRISPR? How do they (or might their outcomes) affect academic
  research and clinical trials? Are commercial investments halted
  until the patent issues are resolved?

how are they different?

what do you work on?
not applied; basic understanding

delivery is not number crunching
