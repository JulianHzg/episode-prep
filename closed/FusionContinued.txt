Steps to getting here
--------------------------------
How does/did each of them contribute?

1920s: Understanding stars 
  chem energy => binding energy
  fusion 4 x 1 nuclei  => 1x4
  mass defect
  
1950s: A kick-start for fusion
  perhapsatron

1960s: The tokamak 
  stellarator

1960s: Superconducting magnets

1970s: Bootstrap current
  
1980s: H-mode
  
1980s: Plasma shaping
  mech stress
  airbus 

1990s: Deuterium-tritium fuel
  first gen fuel
  benefit of fusion no radioact
 
2000s: Supercomputers
  


The Current Status
----------------------------------------
* What is the current state of ITER
  - building progress
  - project/financial status
* Quick recap of ITER's goal
* Updated timeframe for real-world fusion energy?
  20 years :-) ?

* Overview over other relevant fusion research
  Stellarator
  
* Fusion startups
  - which exist?
  - outlook compared to governmental projects?
  - cold fusion



Engineering/Materials:
--------------------------------
* Why is the complexity of fusion a reason for confidence 
  in its future?
  
* How much maintainability can be introduced into 
  fusion plant design? 
  (Making part replacement easier 
  to shorten maintenance downtimes)

* iter does not take away the energy

* What is a reasonable prognosis for the availability of 
  a future fusion plant? 
  (How much maintenance downtime per productive uptime)  
  
* How does the environmental footprint of a fusion 
  plantsÂ´ part production and 
  construction compare to those of the alternatives 
  mentioned in the book? 
  (The CO2 output of solar cell production is 
  mentioned, that of the materials for 
  fusion (Tungsten etc.) is not)  
  
* To what degree does fusion actually solve the fission's 
  radioactive waste 
  and weapons proliferation problems? 
  (as Jason mentioned)



Economics
--------------------------------------
* What electricity network architecture is necessary 
  for the accommodation 
  of future fusion plants? 
  - It's traditional/centralized, right?
  - See also: North/South connection project in Germany 
    and its difficulties
  - how does it fit with decentralization, smaller plants?

* how many of these would we need?

* economic positive energy

* What could be a suitable form of organisation to run 
  these plants?
* How likely is it that fusion plants will be operated by current energy enterprises? 
  (Business models: Public-Private Partnerships, 
  could Fusion lead to 
   socialisation of electricity infrastructure?)
* Does the heavy industry need to adapt for the 
production of fusion plant components? 
  (Are the required materials exotic do they 
  require unusual manufacturing processes?)

* against fusion
* why not just solar?

Future
-------------------------
* What are the communities' plans for after ITER?
