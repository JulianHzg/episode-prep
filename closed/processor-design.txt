* Introduction of Lex Augusteijn

Basics 
----------------------------------------------------

* Computer Architecture vs. Processor Architecture
  - Difference between the two
  - CPU vs. other Processors, eg. for graphics
  - RAM
  - Caches
  - Buses
  - SoC (System on a Chip)

* We'll talk mostly about the CPU, so: Basics Processor
  - ALU
  - Registers
  - Controller
  - Memory (Data)
  - Memory (Program)
  - Program Counter
  how do those play together roughly; later explain details
 
* More details on Processor components
  - Actual computation (ALU)
    . arithmentic
    . logic
    . what goes in and out, buses
  - instruction decoder
    . what are machine instructions, how are they structured
    . how long, different word lenghts
    . fixed length, var length
    . big/little endian
  - Register 
    . Small memory locations in processor, access fast!
    . Adress registers
    . data registers
    . instruction pointer registers
  - Connections
    . data bus
    . address bus
    . Why external memory, why not just lots of registers?
    . Direct Memory Access (DMA) by other devices - how common/important is it in practice?
  - Clock / clock decoder
    . power used in distributing clock over the processor. Some say this is very significant.
    . Internal synchronization issues in processor?
  - Control unit?
  - Integration of the components, von Neumann Cycle:
    . fetch, decode, execute, writeback
  - L1, L2 caches, memory hierarchy
    . generally the importance of caching, 
    . the challenge of cache invalidation
  - Interrupts 
    . do all processors have them?
    . what is the challenge?
    . predictability and provability of processors and the effect that interrupts play
    . Real-Time computing and Interrupts
  - Loose ends:
    . Chipset: North Bridge / South Bridge
    . Execution levels: protection, rings
  
* Variants
  - von Neumann vs. Harvard architecture
  - RISC cs. CISC: trade-offs? Growing together?
  - 8, 16, 32, 64 bit is about what?
  
* Microcode 
  - what is this?
  - in which language is it "written"?
  - abstraction levels
  - Rumors of a Minix operating system in the processor?
  - Fixing bugs like SPECTRE in the processor?
  
* How is a processor booted? Steps!

Optimizations in Modern Processors
----------------------------------------------------

* Optimization in modern Processors
  - Pipelining & Instruction-Level Parallelism
  - Caching also part of this aspect?
  - Deeper Pipelines – Superpipelining
  - Superscalar Execution - what is this?
  - Branch Prediction
    . static vs. dynamic
    . two-bit prediction scheme
  - Speculative Execution
    . can only be done for stuff with no sideeffects, right?
  - Explicit Parallelism – VLIW
  - Register Renaming
  - Instruction Scheduling, Register Renaming & OoO Execution
  - Threads 
    SMT, Hyper-Threading, SIMD
  - Multi-Core
    Identical vs specialized cores

  -> How much improvements do these all bring?

* How are these things integrated with compilers?
  - Do compilers specifically "generate code" for these features?
    how? examples?
  - spatial vs. temporal computing?
  

Additional Concerns
----------------------------------------------------

* Security
  - EP
  - ASLR
  - endbrach 
  - shadow stack
   
* Energy efficiency
  - is this only a proc h/w issue,
  - or also relates to proc design?
  - Clock? See above
  - Thermodynamic limit to energy efficiency?

* Virtualization: support for hypervisors.


History
----------------------------------------------------

* over time 
  - Z80
  - Intel 8080, 8086, 80286, 386, Pentium, .... Core I7
  - Motorola 68000
  - IBM Alpha
  - IBM Power
  - Curiosity: VAX, Cray
* In parallel:
  - Intel
  - ARM
  - GPUs
  - FPU
  - FPGA as coprocessor? Or as fabric for (ARM) processor cores?

* Specialized processors for programming systems (e.g. processor that 
  has FORTH as its "assembly" and has a separate stack memory)?
   
Processor Design ("idea to chip")
--------------------------------------------------
* Layers
  - Specification
  - Architecture
  - Register Transfer (VHDL)
  - Netlist (Gates and memories)
  - Netlist (Transistors)
  - Layout
* Where do the requirements come from?
* How are ideas "tried out"?
* (How) do you do performance prediction? Models?
* Is the physical layout important (length of connections, speed of light)
* 45 nm process vs 14 nm process vs etc.
  - What size does this refer to, and how is it reduced?
  -  Practical impact - improved speed? power efficiency? anything else?
  - Where are we and how far can we expect to go? 
    
* Research - what is currently being researched?
 - Limits of current CPU manufacturing and design processes (few atom layers left)
 - Quantum Computing - Differences, What will be possible and what will NOT be possible
