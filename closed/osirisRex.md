Overview
-------------------------------------------

* What is OSIRIS-REx and where is it going?
  - Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer
* Why? What is the scientific goal?
* Why this particular asteroid?
  - Easy to reach 
  - or scientifically especially interesting.
* What sensors does the spacecraft have for the science?
* What's new? What will OSIRIS-REx do that's never been done before?
* When did it launch? How long do we expect the trip to be?
* The spacecraft itself
  - sizes, weights
  - bus systems (not scientific) 
  - Electronics, Processors, Software, Languages.


How to get there - and back
-------------------------------------------------------

* Trajectory overview.
* Slingshot. Explain.
* What is the required precision wrt. to timing, locations, etc.
  to make such a slingshot work?
* Can a slingshot change the orbital plane/inclination?  
  - Bennu is six degrees off ... 
  - I thought one can only boost "in plane"?
* How have previous missions helped NASA perfect the art of the gravity assist?
* Which kinds of trajectory-altering burns are necessary
* How do you monitor, control, the trajectory?
* Longer "sleep" phases?
* What kind of propulsion? Chemical vs. Electric?


Redezvous/Landing
------------------------------------------------------
* More like a "docking" as in Rosetta? Or real "landing"?
  - What is the gravitational situation like?
  - How does it "anchor" itself to the asteroid?
  
* How do you technically grab the sample? 
  - Drill?

Sample Return
------------------------------------------
* Why not do the science there?
  - is it easier to get material back vs.
  - bringing the lab there for in-situ analysis?
* What kind of science do we hope to gain from studying Bennu, 
  especially with samples here on Earth?
* How do you determine when and where to get the sample from Bennu?

* How to get back? 
  - "Reverse" the trajectory to get there feasible?
  - How long will it stay? The asteroid will have moved on wrt. earth
    at the time of return. Different trajectory?

* When back? arrive at Earth in 2023.

Other science
--------------------------------------------
* map the asteroid in exquisite detail
* study its orbit and interior
* coincidental? Pictures of Jupiter.
