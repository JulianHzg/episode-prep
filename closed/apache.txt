* Overview
  - Purpose historically and today
  - We will primarily talk about the D variant.

* Structure, Design, Systems
  - do a little walkaround and talk about the main systems/components
  - Pilot in the back - why?
  - Crash protection?
  - No crew escape system, right?
  - X-shaped rotor. Strange.
  - How is the Longbow different beyond the obvious radar on the mast?
  
* Robustness
  - Self-Sealing Tanks
  - How does the main rotor sustain a hit?
  - FOD & turbines, cable cutters
  - redundancy with the controls between the two operators (in case of wounds/injury/etc)?


* Weapons
  - Gun
  - Rockets
  - Mavericks
  - sidewinders? other Air-to-Air?


* Avionics
  - Displays and Systems
  - What do the chin turret sensors do?
  - Acqusition systems and target classification
  - Longbow Radar
  - Helmet mounted Display
    - gun slewing
    - flying ("the tunnel")
  - Weather/night




* A preflight check

* Flying the Apache
  - Crew Collaboration
  - Can both fly (systems and qual?)
  - Crew escape in emergency?
  - How does the upwards facing exhausts affect airflow through 
    the rotor (lift/turbulence etc)?
    As the helicopter’s velocity increases, the exhaust gases would hit the rotor 
    blade further back (towards the tail). How do they compensate for this?

  - Variants, Differences, Timeline





  - IFR 
  - Numbers: speed, altitude, endurance/range
  - No air-to-air refuelling. How is in-mission refuelling done?

  - Low-level flying
    dangers: trees, sand, power lines
  - Autorotate from low alt?


  - Collaboration with ground crew
  - collab with each other
    . roles
    . Kiowas, back in the day. Why no more?
  - Collaboration with other flying units; 
    . USAF?
    . laser desig

  - CAS: low/agile helos vs. A-10s vs. loitering drones
  JSTarts
  - Helo gun/maverick vs. LGB from plane. Damage Assessment easier?

designator
  - Data Integration with other systems
  - Who is the Army's "AWACS"?



* Missions
  - Tank Busting
  - Sandy

  - Support of ground forces
  - Recon
  
  - air 2 air: training und chancen?


gs

* Some of your work with the Apache
  - exercise in the baltics
  - where else did you fly, and what did you do?

exereciye infrastructure

* Replacemnt by 66?
  "see" drones?

  
* Cowboy Hat vs- indians
