ENGINEER
==================================================

Intro & Goals
--------------------------------------
* What are the goals?
  - mountain wave breaking
  - impact on avionic systems
  - subtropical tropopause /jet / frontal structure
  - impact on cloud formation processes
* Atmospheric Research vs. Gliding Records
* Spin-Offs into Airbus?
* Team
  - how big?
  - members, roles
  - who had the idea?
* How did it come about? Bit of history.


The Aircraft
------------------------------------------
* Pressure cabin?
  - Trade-off with pressure suits
  - To which alt does the cabin pressurize?
  - other life support equip? Redundant oxygen?
  - Rebreather?
* General
  - Layout
  - Dimensions
  - round windows
* Special Profiles/Cross-sections 
  - for low Re-numbers (why do we have those?)
  - mass balancing for aerosurfaces
  - experimental? Which FAR
  - Vne 
  - What is the max flight alt of Perlan II?
  - flapped
  - L/D
* Design and Calculations
X  - From which other a/c did you learn what?
  - In particular from Perlan I
  - Wing Design and Flutter
  - Why the rounded rudder tip?
* Avionics
X  - special wave tracking/mapping?
  - Does a pressure-based flight recorder work at those altitudes?
* Night lighting?
* Which science instrumentation?
* Talk through the flight testing process


Missions
---------------------------------------
* Where do you fly from, and why?
* How do you get the airplane there?
  - Trailer in Container.
* Wave forcast
  - what goes into the models?
  - who prepares them?
X  - wave model for 100'000ft (are these conventional waves)?
X  - standard models capable of predictions in 100'000ft?
X* Wind speeds on the ground and aloft?
X  - Generally, what's the weather like on good days?

* Flight/Mission Planning
  - How about airspaces?
  - Any other traffic at FL1000?
* Cooperation with ground support
  - Radio?
  - Telemetry?
* World record flight - weather, profile?
* What goes into officially establishing a world record?
  - Logging
  - Calibration?
* Who had the world record before? By how much did you beat it?

* What do you guys expect is possible beyond it?
Penetraing


PILOT
==================================================
* Walk us through a typical flying day
  - Briefing
  - Weather
  - Preflight: what's special for Perlan II?
* What did you learn from Perlan 1, beyond the fact that
   you want a pressure cabin?
* How do you stay in the wave?
  - Experience?
  - Feel?
  - Avionics?
* How does the airplane handle "down low"
  - are there typically high winds on good days
    close to the ground? Challenge?
* At what airspeeds do you typically fly up high?
* Coffin Corner. 
  - Careful flying
  - special a/c design?
* Did you train what to do if the pressure cabin dies?
  - Special trainign wrt. to hypoxia?
  - Drogue chute
  - Ballistic chute - interesting, never really quite worked for gliders so far
* What other contingencies are planned for?
* What are some other challenges in this very high wave flying?
* Autopilot?
* Collaboration with ATC during a flight
* How did you guys select the pilots?
* Licenses? VFR? Night-VFR? IFR?
* Discuss some of the (emotional) aspects/impressions "up there".
